The Digital Court Case Management System is a Java-based console (text-based) application designed to digitally manage court-related records.
It helps in maintaining, updating, and retrieving case information efficiently.
The system supports two main user roles:
Admin – can manage (add, update, delete) court cases.
User – can view case details and track case status.
The project is connected to MySQL Database (through SQL Workbench) using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
In Eclipse → Right-click on CourtManagementSystem.java
